# Agent AI Travel Recommendation  

Agent AI Travel Recommendation is a web-based application that helps users plan their trips by leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and APIs. This project serves as a demo version, limited to the 100 largest cities in Europe, and demonstrates the power of AI-driven travel recommendations through a conversational interface.  

## Features  
- **Flight Search:** Users can search for flights based on departure city, destination, dates, and budget using Kiwi API.  
- **Weather Forecasts:** Get a 5-day weather forecast for your destination using OpenWeather API.  
- **Top Attractions & Restaurants:** Discover the best attractions and restaurants in a city, powered by Google Places API and Wikipedia API.  
- **Personalized Conversations:** Engage with an intelligent AI agent using Google Vertex AI, designed to assist with travel-related queries.  
- **History Tracking:** View and manage past searches and conversations.  
- **PDF Generation:** Export detailed travel information as PDF files for offline use.
